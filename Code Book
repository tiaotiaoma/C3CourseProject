The run_analyis.R file is the R code for the course project of getting and cleaning data.
The data was firsted downloaded and unzipped into the folder "c3data" in the working directory. Then the package "dplyr" was used to read 
8 data files into R with added column names. The 8 data files are:
  1) features - contains 561 variables for the data set (dim = 561 x 2).
  2) actvities - include code for the 6 different activities (dim = 6 x 2).
  3) subject_train - the identifier of subject for training data (dim = 7352 x 1)
  4) y_train - the code of activity that subjects performed for the training data (dim = 7352 x 1)
  5) x_train - the measurment on the 561 variables on the subject for the training data (dim = 7352 x 561)
  6) subject_test - the identifier of subject for test data (dim = 2947 x 1)
  7) y_test - the code of activity that subjects performed for the test data (dim = 2947 x 1)
  8) x_test - the measurment on the 561 variables for the subjects for the test data (dim = 2947 x 561)
#1 the traing and the test data set was merged to create one data set 
  train - a data set for traing with subject, activity code, and all measurment variables  
  test - a data set for test with subject, activity code, and all measurment variables  
  merged - a tidy data set was created by merging training and test data set
  
 #2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   mean_stdv - a data set containg subject, code and mean and standard deviation for each meansruemnt only
  
 #3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    The data set "merged" has descriptive activity instead of code
    
 # 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
     The data set "merged" gpt more descriptive on the variable names
     
 # 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    subAct was data set grouped by subject and activity on the data set "merged" from step 4
    tidydata 2 was data set that avearged the measurment of all variables based on subject and activity 
    
    tidydata 2 was written as "tidydata2. txt"
